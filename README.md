WoWLocaleTool is a Python script designed to extract localization strings from Lua files in World of Warcraft addons. It recursively scans all Lua files in a specified directory (including subdirectories), extracts localization strings based on WOW ACE3Local implementation, and saves them into a single Lua file.

## Features

- Recursively scan all Lua files in the specified directory
- Support for custom directory exclusion
- Extract multiple localization string identifiers (default: L, AL, C)
- Save extracted strings to a single Lua file with source file comments
- Support for custom file encoding
- Display processing progress and total execution time
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)

## System Requirements

- Python 3.6+

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.

## Usage

Run the script from the command line using the following format:

```bash
python wowlocale_tool.py [options]
```

### Optional Arguments

| Argument | Long Form | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `-s` | `--source` | Source directory (default: script directory) |
| `-t` | `--target` | Target directory (default: "Dict" folder in script directory) |
| `-e` | `--exclude` | Additional directories to exclude |
| `-c` | `--encoding` | File encoding (default: utf-8) |
| `-i` | `--identifiers` | List of localization string identifiers (default: L,AL,C) |

### Examples

1. Using default settings:

   ```bash
   python wowlocale_tool.py
   ```

2. Specifying source and target directories:

   ```bash
   python wowlocale_tool.py -s /path/to/addon -t /path/to/output
   ```

3. Adding extra exclude directories and using custom encoding:

   ```bash
   python wowlocale_tool.py -e extra_dir1 extra_dir2 -c utf-16
   ```

4. Using custom localization string identifiers:

   ```bash
   python wowlocale_tool.py -i L,T,X
   ```

## Output

The script generates a file named `localization_strings.lua` in the specified target directory. This file contains all extracted localization strings in the following format:

```lua
--/path/to/file1.lua
L["string1"] = "string1"
L["string2"] = "string2"

--/path/to/file2.lua
L["string3"] = "string3"
L["string4"] = "string4"
```

## Notes

- Directories excluded by default: Language, lang, Local, locales, locale, locals, dict (case-insensitive).
- The script automatically creates the target directory if it doesn't exist.
- Progress and total execution time are displayed to monitor processing of large addons.
